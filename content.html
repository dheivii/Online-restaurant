            At Foodies, we deliver this with delicacies made with hand-picked ingredients cooked to perfection, and
            served with love! With every meal, we serve happy memories and love stories.<br>After finishing a work
            meeting, we decided to head out for lunch. FOODIES hotel was recommended and so we decided to try it out.

            The first impression was a good one. Itâ€™s a Chettinad restaurent and must compliment them for the wonderful,
            well thought out design that did justice to the place.

            Attention to details such as brass taps, black and white flooring, colonial furniture, old photos and even
            the vintage switches. I wish they has used vintage fans. This could have greatly added to the authentic
            ambience.

            Here are a few photos of the restaurent.
            <br> Chettinad cuisine is the cuisine of a community called the Nattukotai Chettiars, or Nagarathars, from
            the Chettinad region in Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu state in India.Chettinad cuisine is perhaps the
            most renowned fare in the Tamil Nadu repertoire.It uses a variety of spices and the dishes are made with
            fresh ground masalas. Chettiars also use a variety of sun-dried meats and salted vegetables, reflecting the
            dry environment of the region. Most of the dishes are eaten with rice and rice based accompaniments such as
            dosas, appams, idiyappams, adais and idlis. The Chettiars, through their mercantile contacts with Burma,
            learnt to prepare a type of rice pudding made with sticky red rice.<br> The chefs of manapatti village near
            Singampunari are experts in cooking Chettinad cuisine. They always used to cook in bulk orders for marriage
            functions, political functions, etc.though manapatti cooking is portrayed as madurai cuisine because it is
            located near to madurai district, it comes under chettinad cuisine only and it also comes under the
            chettinad region of sivagangai district. The entire village people is famous in the art of cooking.
